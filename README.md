Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

Like Most: I love that I can follow all the changes and interactions between group mates when doing version control the log and release section is pretty cool

Most Challenging: I sometime find it challenging switching between the UI's of all the different programs we use such as terminal, then in GitHub, and then working on making branches in other programs such as jupyter. Also not fully related but when it comes to deploying and showcasing your work from your repo I always have issues setting that up.
